# Next.js workshop

## What is Next.js

Next.js is a minimalistic framework for server-rendered React applications.

## Setup

Install all the dependencies using [Yarn](https://yarnpkg.com/).

```
$ yarn
```

Run the Next.js server with the dev command:

```
$ yarn run dev
```

The website is now running on <http://localhost:3000>, including automatic
transpilation and hot code reloading.
